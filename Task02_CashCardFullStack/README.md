# Architecture

### Backend

* Project backend is based on a 3-layer architecture, specifically controllers, service, and DAO layer.
* Controllers exposes the API end-points. Controller class accepts all api request which are then passed to the service layer.
* Service layer takes care of the bussiness logic before doing database access.
* DAO layer acts as an interface between the database and the service layer.
* Basic authorization is implemented using Spring security
